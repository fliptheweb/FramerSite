	<h4>Requirements</h4>
	<p class="subtitle">
		We are looking for product-minded engineers that would like to work on interactive design and programming tools, like Framer.
	</p>
	<p>
		We strongly prefer full-time people in Amsterdam. We're a small, but well funded start-up and have growing revenue. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone is a product designer at Framer. The things we want to build have to be invented and live on the border between deep technology, great design and the art of building things.
	</p>
	<p>
		You should have a subset of skills in JavaScript, Objective-C, C, WebGL, OpenGL, Python, Ruby. Experience with WebKit internals, Graphics Programming, Skia, Physics Engines and Code Parsing are a plus. A strong Computer Science background is also a plus, but we also hire great self-taught people with work to show for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The kind of person we are looking for is someone that can work hard, but also keep sane hours. People with great ideas, strong opinions, but also who can ship â€“ a maker. People who take responsibility, in- and outside of defined roles to make themselves unmissable for the company, and to grow into senior roles quickly.
	</p>
