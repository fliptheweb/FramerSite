### Importing <a name="overview"></a>

The importer lets you import Sketch or Photoshop documents directly into Framer. All of your layer groups will be available. Your layer hierarchy is respected and all flattened layers are exported too. 

---

##### Get Started
To import layers, click the **"Import"** icon in the toolbar. 

You'll be presented with the Import Sheet, where you can import designs directly out of Sketch, Sketch Beta and Photoshop. 

<img class="ss-import-sheet" src="/static/images/learn/ss-import-sheet.png" srcset="/static/images/learn/ss-import-sheet@2x.png 2x" draggable="false">

The import sheet informs you about the state of the applications. When they are unavailable for import, they can be in two different states:

<ul class="numbered">
<li><strong>Not running</strong> - The application isn't open </li>
<li><strong>Open a saved document</strong> - There's no open document or the document hasn't been saved</li>
</ul>

When you've opened a saved document, the Import button will become active and you'll see the title of your active document appear below the application title.

----

##### Re-Importing
Subsequent imports from the same file will work as long as you don't rename layers that you've already targeted within Framer. This allows for rapid iteration, especially with the keyboard shortcut: **CMD + Shift + I**
