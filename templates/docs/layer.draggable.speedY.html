###### layer.draggable.speedY <span>number</span>
<a id="layer.draggable.speedY"></a>

Modify the vertical dragging speed. The value is in pixels per mouse moved pixels. The default value is 1. When set lower then 1 dragging will be slower than mouse movement and vice versa. You can set the value to 0 to disable vertical dragging.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()
layerA.draggable.enabled = true

# Make vertical dragging slow
layerA.draggable.speedY = 0.1

# Make vertical dragging fast
layerA.draggable.speedY = 10
</pre>
