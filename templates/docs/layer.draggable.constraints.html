###### layer.draggable.constraints <span>object</span>
<a id="layer.draggable.constraints"></a>
Constraints for the area this layer can be dragged within. If you also set the x and y properties as constraints, the layer will snap to that position on DragStart. The layer will animate to the new point on click.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()
layerA.draggable.enabled = true

# Set dragging constraints
layerA.draggable.constraints = {x:0, y:0, width:200, height:200}
</pre>
