<a id="scroll.scrollcomponent"></a>
A ScrollComponent is used to scroll content. It implements momentum and spring physics, allows for customization, and emits different events.

The ScrollComponent is built with two layers. The ScrollComponent itself is a layer that masks its content. It has a content layer that has draggable enabled and constraints configured. It automatically manages the size of the content layer based on the total size of the sub layers of the content layer.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
# Create a new ScrollComponent
scroll = new ScrollComponent({width:100, height:100)}

# Include a Layer
layer = new Layer({superLayer:scroll.content})
</pre>

You can also wrap an existing layer within a ScrollComponent, using `ScrollComponent.wrap()`. The ScrollComponent will insert itself in-between the content and its super layer. This is useful when you've imported designs from Sketch or Photoshop and want to make a layer scrollable. You can <a href="#scroll.wrap">learn more</a> about wrapping in the learn section.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layer = new Layer({width:300, height:300})
scroll = ScrollComponent.wrap(layer)
</pre>


##### Compatibility

Before the ScrollComponent, Framer relied on native browser scrolling with `layer.scroll`. This is still supported, and allows you to experiment with native scrolling and trackpad scrolling.
