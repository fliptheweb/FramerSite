###### ScrollComponent
<a id="scroll.scrollcomponent"></a>
A ScrollComponent is used scroll content. It implements momentum and spring physics, allows for customization and emits different events.

The ScrollComponent is built with two layers. The ScrollComponent itself is a layer that masks its content. It has a content layer that has draggable enabled and constraints configured. It automatically manages the size of the content layer based on the total size of the sub layers of the content layer.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
# Create a new ScrollComponent
scroll = new ScrollComponent({width:100, height:100)}

# Include a Layer
layer = new Layer({superLayer:scroll.content})
</pre>

Rather than building up a ScrollComponent from scratch, you can wrap an existing layer in a ScrollComponent automatically with `ScrollComponent.wrap()`. The ScrollComponent will insert itself inbetween the content and its super layer. This is handy when you for example import a stucture from Sketch or Photoshop and want to make a layer scrollable.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layer = new Layer({width:300, height:300})
scroll = ScrollComponent.wrap(layer)
</pre>

Before the ScrollComponent we relied on native browser scrolling with `layer.scroll`. This is still possible, for compatibility sake, and it's good to just have native scrolling available for example when you want to test things like trackpad scrolling. But it is importand to understand that these are different, or you might get confused.
