###### layer.z <span>number</span>
<a id="layer.z"></a>

The z property of a layer defines its z position in space, also known as depth. The larger this value, the further away the object is away from the point of view. 

Remember that you will have to enable perspective on a parent layer before you can see this effect. Also note the z property is different from layer.index (z-index) which defines the order for layers when they all have the same z value.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()
layerA.z = 500
</pre>
