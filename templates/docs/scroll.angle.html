###### scroll.angle <span>number</span>
<a id="scroll.angle"></a>

Current scrolling angle (in degrees). The scrolling angle is the inverse of the direction of the drag action: when dragging downwards, you're effectively scrolling upwards. <br> This property is read-only.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
scroll = new ScrollComponent()

# On scroll, print the angle
scroll.on Events.Scroll, ->
	print scroll.angle
</pre>
