###### layer.draggable.propagateEvents <span>boolean</span>
<a id="layer.draggable.propagateEvents"></a>

Set the propagateEvents property of a draggable layer. Set to true by default. This is useful when working with draggable layers within ScrollComponents or PageComponents, or nested Components.

Let's say you'd like to have a draggable layer within the scroll.content layer. By default, moving the layer will also move the scroll.content. This is because both layers will listen to the dragging events. 

To prevent any draggable subLayer from passing events to its superLayer, set propagateEvents to false. This applies to all nested draggable layers.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
scroll = new ScrollComponent({
    width: Screen.width, 
    height: Screen.height
})

scroll.content.backgroundColor = "#28affa"

layerA = new Layer({
	superLayer: scroll.content,
	backgroundColor: "#fff"
})

layerA.draggable.enabled = true

# Setting propagateEvents to false allows you to drag layerA
# without also scrolling within the ScrollComponent
layerA.draggable.propagateEvents = false
</pre>
