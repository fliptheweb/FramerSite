###### layer.clip <span>boolean</span>
<a id="layer.clip"></a>
Sets wether the layer should clip its sub layers. Clipping is enabled by default.

Note that clipping with rounded corners enabled can be buggy, because the browser cannot take the hardware accelerated rendering path. If you need it anyway you can enable layer.force2d on all the sub layers that need to be clipped.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer({width:100, height:100})
layerB = new Layer({width:200, height:200, superLayer:layerA})

layerA.clip = false
</pre>
