###### page.originY <span>number</span>
<a id="page.originY"></a>

The origin is defined as a number between `0` and `1`, where `0` is the left-edge and `1` the right-edge. The default value is `0.5`, the center.

The originX value defines how pages will be snapped-to vertically.
Note that the effects of adjusting originY can only be seen when the width of a page is smaller than the PageComponent.
