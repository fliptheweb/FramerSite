### Print
<a name="print"></a>
Printing allows you to inspect variables on runtime. It works similarly to console.log, only when using print, the output is shown directly within your prototype. Note that you need to use print() in Javascript (but not in CoffeeScript). We will omit these in the rest of the docs.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
print "Hello" # Output: "Hello"
</pre>

You can inspect any type of value, and even multiple at the same time.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer({x:20, name:"Hi"})

# A single property value
print layerA.x
# Output: 20

# Multiple values
print layerA.x, layerA.opacity, layerA.name
# Output: 20, 1.0, "Hi"
</pre>
