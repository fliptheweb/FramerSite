###### layer.states.add(name <span>string</span>, state <span>object</span> | states <span>object</span>)
<a id="layer.states.add"></a>
Adds a layer state. Each layer state is a collection of layer properties and values. You can add them one by one with a name and property object or all at once with an object containing the layer names and properties.

There is always at least one state "default" with the property values that the layer was created with.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()

# Add a single state
layerA.states.add("stateA", {x:500, opacity:0.5})

# Add a multiple states
layerA.states.add({
	stateA: {x:500, opacity:0.5},
	stateB: {x:200, opacity:1},
})
</pre>
