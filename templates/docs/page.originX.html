###### page.originX <span>number</span>
<a id="page.originX"></a>

The origin is defined as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is the left-edge and 1 the right-edge. The default value is 0.5, the center.

The originX value defined how pages will be snapped-to horizontally. 
Note that the effects of adjusting the originX can only be seen when the height of a page is smaller than the PageComponent.
