###### scroll.direction <span>string</span>
<a id="scroll.direction"></a>

Current scrolling direction. Returns "up", "down", "left" or "right". The scrolling direction is reversed: if you're dragging downwards, you're effectively scrolling upwards. This property is read-only.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
scroll = new ScrollComponent()

# On scroll, print the direction
scroll.on Events.Scroll, ->
	print scroll.direction
</pre>
