###### scroll.direction <span>string</span>
<a id="scroll.direction"></a>

Current scrolling direction. Returns `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`. The scrolling direction is the inverse of the direction of the drag action: when dragging downwards, you're effectively scrolling upwards. This property is read-only.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
scroll = new ScrollComponent()

# On scroll, print the direction
scroll.on Events.Scroll, ->
	print scroll.direction
</pre>
