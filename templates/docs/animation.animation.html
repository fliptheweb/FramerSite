Animation objects manage an animations that target a layer and a set of properties.

An animation will tween between a start and end value with a curve. The start value will be determined the moment the animation starts and the end value will be defined in properties. Only properties pass into the options will be animated by the animation. If the end values are equal to the current value, they won't animate.

You can have multiple animations target the same layer as long as they don't target the same properties. If you start two animations both targeting x for the same layer, the second one will fail.

Only numeric layer properties can be animated. The full list is x, y, z, width, height, opacity, rotation, rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ, scale scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, originX, originY, scrollX, scrollY, borderRadius, borderWidth, shadowX, shadowY, shadowBlur, shadowSpread, blur, brightness, saturate, hueRotate, contrast, invert, grayscale, sepia. You can also animate the dynamic properties minX, midX, maxX, minY, midY and maxY.

Most properties can benefit from gpu accelerated drawing and you can animate many of them without hurting your frame rate. But some properties need to involve the CPU to animate and are therefore more expensive to render. The full list is width, height, scrollX, scrollY,borderRadius, borderWidth.

To listen to animation events like start, stop and end please see the <a href="#events.table">animation events</a>. Animation events will be passed onto the animated layer as well with the animation as the first argument.
