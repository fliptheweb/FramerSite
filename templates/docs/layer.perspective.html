###### layer.perspective <span>number</span>
<a id="layer.perspective"></a>
Sets the perspective for child layers. Perspective gives depth to 3d properties like rotationX, rotationY. The rotation is set from 1 to Infinity where 1 is a huge perspective. Setting perspective to 0 gives you an isometric effect. Perspective is disabled by default.

Because of the way Safari renders, the perspective property can disable retina quality rendering. I think this is a bug and will be solved at some point. When used with rotation and/or animation you don't notice this too much though.

<pre lang="coffeescript">
layerA = new Layer()

# Set the perspective for all sub layers
layerA.perspective = 100

layerB = new Layer({superLayer:layerA})
layerB.rotationY = 30
layerB.rotationX = 30

</pre>
